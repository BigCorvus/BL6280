# BL6280
The BL6280 by a compny called Betterlife is a controller for capacitive touch screens usually found on dirt-cheap chinese U80 "Smartwatches".
This is a simple Arduino library for interacting with the chip via I2C.
The U8 clones have become so stripped-down that they have their touch controllers sitting on the main PCB. You don't want these variants. Instead you want those where the chip is sitting on a flex-rigid PCB assembly with a 6-pin 0.5mm pitch FPC connector.
